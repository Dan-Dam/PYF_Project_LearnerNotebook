📊 FoodHub Delivery Data Analysis
Final Project - Python Foundations | Data Analytics Essentials Program
McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin

📁 Project Overview
This project is the final assignment in the Python Foundations module of the Data Analytics Essentials Professional Program at the McCombs School of Business. The analysis focuses on operational data from FoodHub, a food delivery aggregator, and aims to uncover actionable insights related to restaurant performance, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objective
To analyze key aspects of the online food delivery ecosystem using Python and data analysis techniques, with a focus on:

Restaurant ratings and customer behavior

Delivery time vs food preparation time

Cost optimization and order patterns

Identifying operational bottlenecks and opportunities

📚 Dataset Context
The dataset includes real-world operational data from FoodHub, including:

Customer orders

Cuisine types

Delivery and preparation times

Ratings and costs

The data simulates how customers interact with the platform, and how restaurants and delivery personnel respond.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Wrangling & Cleaning

Statistical Visualization

Descriptive Analytics

🧪 Key Analysis & Features
Trend analysis of delivery and preparation times

Distribution of ratings by restaurant and cuisine

Filtering for high-performing restaurants (e.g., ratings > 4 and count > 50)

Business recommendations based on exploratory data analysis (EDA)

📈 Outcome
The final deliverable includes actionable insights for:

Improving delivery logistics

Enhancing user satisfaction through high-rated restaurant filtering

Reducing order time variance for better predictability
